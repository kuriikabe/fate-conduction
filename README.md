# fate-conduction

“Every equation is a prayer. Every route a proof of the human condition.”

Fate/Conduction is a visual novel project set in an alternate Fate/stay night continuity, following Keiji Yukimura, a magus forged by Atlas and entangled in the Fifth Holy Grail War.
The story explores psychological reconstruction, identity, and the cost of human connection through four converging routes:

🧮 FORMULA — Origin and self-discovery at Homurahara.

🧩 THEORY — War, collapse, and emotional dissonance.

⚫ REDACTED — Failed loops, suicides, betrayals, and alternate timelines.

💠 PROOF — The true convergence; the meaning of Conduction.

Each route intertwines gameplay logic with emotional consequence—every choice alters Keiji’s “circuit stability,” “alignment,” and “affinity” toward the people who define him.
